The competition is about predicting the probabilities of more than 150,000 match outcomes from 2019 to 2021 using the recent sequence of 10 matches of the teams.\n","And our goal is to apply machine learning models on the given dataset and try to compare the result with the bookmakers odds. \\\n","\n","### **Approach**\n","We plan to use Python as our main programming language with Pandas, numpy and matplotlib package for data wrangling and visualization. Scikit-Learn、 Tensorflow(LSTM model) are leveraged for data training, prediction and validation. Concretely, the scikit-Learn is utilized to scale data, implement cross validation and also compute log-loss to validate the prediction. Tensorflow is a platform to implement our machine learning models, we eventually chose a Long short-term memory model, the LSTM model to train the datasets.\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o0qu024jeaYy"},"source":["#### 1.
